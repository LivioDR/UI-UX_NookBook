## App Concept

Our app concept is a companion app + game wiki for Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH). This app will provide some common features found in similar apps, such as a collection tracker, villager overview, and event calendar. It will also contain additional tools that link directly to the user’s save game*, such as push notifications when certain things happen in game, a dynamic island map, and more. Finally, it will also include wiki integration in appropriate parts of the app to avoid the user having to switch apps repeatedly if they wish to know more about an in-game item, villager, feature, etc.

## Our motivation

This app wouldn’t necessarily impact the overall market of video game companion apps, but it would certainly have an effect on the market for specifically ACNH companion apps, and possibly other indirect competitors like similar companion apps for other farming/life sim games. Per our research presented in this report, there are a handful of decent apps for tracking progress in ACNH, but most of them only have completionist-related features and don’t have the ability to integrate directly with the user’s save game. By adding this integration, our app blows the capabilities that a companion app can have wide open, as well as eliminating some of the tedium that other apps have because the user has to manually enter all of their data. The aim is to make a one-stop-shop app that caters to completionists and more casual players alike.

## *Disclaimer*

*We are aware that integrating directly with the save game, especially remotely via a network connection, is absolutely not something Nintendo would ever actually allow a third party application to do, but since we won’t actually be writing code for the app, we figured this is an acceptable caveat as it opens up a lot of possibilities for app features that wouldn’t normally be doable. We’ll just live in our imaginary fantasy world where Nintendo doesn’t send cease and desist letters to anyone coming close to their IPs (except Palworld, they dodged that bullet somehow) for the purposes of this project.*
